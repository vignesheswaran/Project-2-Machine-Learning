# Compressive Strength of Concrete-Machine learning

1) The datset had 8 independent and a dependent feature.

2) The dataset didnt had any outliers

3) Using heatmap the correlation between the features were analyzised and top 5 features with high correlation are chosen for model building.

4) Random forest Regressor was used for model building after applying several algorithm.

5) The model was exported in pickle file and deployed in Herouku.

Thank you :)
